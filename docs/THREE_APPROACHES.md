# Three Approaches to Job + Skills Data

We provide **three different approaches** to demonstrate flexibility and standards compliance.

---

## Approach 1: Integrated (Proposed JEDx Extension) 🚀

**File:** `job-skills-architecture.json`

**Format:** JEDx job with embedded skills field

**Example:**
```json
{
  "job": {
    "jobId": "SWE-001",
    "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "jobDuties": "...",
    "socInfo": [...],
    "skills": {
      "type": "SkillAssertionCollection",
      "assertions": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Single file/request
- ✅ All data together
- ✅ Natural connection between job and skills
- ✅ Easier for consuming systems

**Status:**
- ⚠️ **Proposed extension** to JEDx
- ✅ Backward compatible (skills field is optional)
- ✅ Based on IMS Global OB v3.0
- 📄 See: `JEDX_SKILLS_PROPOSAL.md`

**Use When:**
- Proposing enhancement to JEDx standard
- Building next-gen HR systems
- Want single payload with everything

---

## Approach 2: Separate Files (Fully Standards-Compliant) ✅

**Files:**
- `job-swe-001.json` (JEDx only)
- `job-swe-001-skills.json` (Skills API only)

**Format:** Two separate entities, linked by ID

**JEDx Job:**
```json
{
  "job": {
    "RefId": "...",
    "jobId": "SWE-001",
    "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "jobDuties": "...",
    "socInfo": [...]
  }
}
```

**Skills (separate):**
```json
{
  "@context": [...],
  "type": "SkillAssertionCollection",
  "targetId": "https://techcorp.example.com/jobs/SWE-001",
  "assertions": [...]
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ 100% standards-compliant
- ✅ JEDx schema valid
- ✅ IMS Global OB v3.0 valid
- ✅ No extensions needed
- ✅ Works today with existing systems

**Status:**
- ✅ Fully compliant with both standards
- ✅ No schema changes needed
- ✅ Production-ready

**Use When:**
- Need strict standards compliance
- Working with existing JEDx systems
- Want maximum interoperability

---

## Approach 3: Dual Endpoints (API Best Practice) 🌐

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/jedx/jobs/SWE-001` → Job only
- `GET /api/v1/jedx/jobs/SWE-001/skills` → Skills only

**Format:** REST API with separate resources

**Request 1:**
```http
GET /api/v1/jedx/jobs/SWE-001

Response:
{
  "job": {
    "jobId": "SWE-001",
    "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Request 2:**
```http
GET /api/v1/jedx/jobs/SWE-001/skills

Response:
{
  "type": "SkillAssertionCollection",
  "targetId": "https://techcorp.example.com/jobs/SWE-001",
  "assertions": [...]
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ RESTful design
- ✅ Clients choose what data they need
- ✅ Separate concerns
- ✅ Cacheable independently
- ✅ Standards-compliant payloads

**Status:**
- ✅ Implemented in demo server
- ✅ Best practice REST API design
- ✅ Production-ready

**Use When:**
- Building REST APIs
- Want flexible data retrieval
- Supporting multiple client needs

## Recommendation by Audience

### Presenting to Standards Bodies (JEDx Governance)
**Use:** Approach 1 (Integrated)
**Why:** Demonstrate proposed enhancement
**Show:** `JEDX_SKILLS_PROPOSAL.md` + working example

### Presenting to Technical Reviewers
**Use:** Approach 3 (Dual Endpoints)
**Why:** Best practice API design
**Show:** Live API with both endpoints working

### Presenting to Compliance Officers
**Use:** Approach 2 (Separate Files)
**Why:** 100% standards-compliant today
**Show:** Files validate against official schemas

### Presenting to Business Stakeholders
**Use:** Approach 1 (Integrated)
**Why:** Easiest to understand "job + skills together"
**Show:** Single JSON file with everything

---

## What We Recommend

**Primary Implementation:** Approach 3 (Dual Endpoints) ✅
- Production-ready today
- Standards-compliant
- Flexible for clients
- RESTful best practices

**Advocacy Effort:** Approach 1 (Integrated) 🚀
- Propose to JEDx community
- Build case for extension
- Demonstrate value
- Gather feedback

**Validation/Compliance:** Approach 2 (Separate Files) ✅
- Keep as reference
- Prove standards compliance
- Use for validation testing

---

## Your Implementation Has All Three!

**Files:**
- ✅ `job-skills-architecture.json` - Integrated approach
- ✅ `job-swe-001.json` - JEDx only (separate)
- ✅ `job-swe-001-skills.json` - Skills only (separate)

**API Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /jobs/SWE-001` - Job data
- ✅ `GET /jobs/SWE-001/skills` - Skills data

**You can demonstrate any approach based on audience!**

## Positioning Statement

> "We've implemented a working system that connects job data to machine-readable skills using industry standards. We're showing three approaches: an integrated format we're proposing as a JEDx enhancement, a fully standards-compliant separated approach, and a REST API that serves both. All three maintain backward compatibility and enable powerful new use cases in skills-based hiring, workforce analytics, and learning-to-work pipelines."

## Next Steps by Approach

### If Pursuing JEDx Extension (Approach 1)
1. Share `JEDX_SKILLS_PROPOSAL.md` with JEDx stakeholders
2. Collect feedback from pilot implementations
3. Demonstrate measurable value (better matching, etc.)
4. Submit formal proposal to standards body

### If Deploying Production System (Approach 3)
1. Deploy API with dual endpoints
2. Document integration guide
3. Onboard client systems
4. Monitor usage and iterate

### If Validating Compliance (Approach 2)
1. Validate files against schemas
2. Submit to compliance review
3. Document standards adherence
4. Get formal sign-off
